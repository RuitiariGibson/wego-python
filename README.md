``wego-python`` "your cool weather tool". Have an existing place you'd like to
visit and want to know the weather conditions prior to your visit at the comfort of your terminal?
Normally, you'd have to use your phone or open your browser and search the weather conditions for the
place.

Here's what's required to receive weather updates/information of a certain place
 using ``wego-python`` :
 .. code:: bash

    $ python3.8 wego_cli.py  # uses the default location which is nairobi
          or
    $ python3.8 wego_cli.py  --location Nairobi  # the city you want to search for
*That's it. !*
